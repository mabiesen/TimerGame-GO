# TimerGame-Go
Timer Game in Golang as Programming Challenge with Fixed Criteria

Criteria is as follows:

1.  Write code in a functional manner such that code may be re-used in other projects
  * Code should be as simplistic as possible, doing one specific task only when possible
  * Code should use as few public variables as possible
  * Main function should contain only function calls
2.  Thoroughly note all functions and variables used in the project
  * Notes should include parameters, description, returns, necessary packages, necessary sister functions, etc.
3.  Thoroughly test all functions and variables used in project with Go's built in testing.
4.  Game Objective: The Timer Game records all game on/off time and presents to the user.

Game Flow is as follows:
* User is prompted to type 's' to start game.  Game does not move forward until user types 's'
* The game begins in 'off' mode.  User can type 't' to toggle game into 'on' or 'off' mode
* When user types 'x', the game stops.  Information regarding game time is then presented to the user.
